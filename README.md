# Media Player
Hello! I hope you enjoy my application.
This was the first project I uploaded to github. A lot of my older projects are private but I kept this one up because for it was the first.

##  How to use
1. Make sure to download java 8 at oracle.com which works for any operating system.
2. Download the .jar file from the releases tab and you should be able to run it!
